  <p>"Iâ€™m so pleased to notify you of your acceptance into the <a href="https://valar.quantic.edu/executive-mba/" target="_blank"> Valar Executive MBA</a> - Class of September 2023."</p>

  <p>The Cultural Intelligence course I took tonight was certainly edifying when it came to understanding why I am struggling so much to connect with my peers at The Company. They're not <i>wrong</i>, they're just...different.</p>
  <p><b>REALLY</b> different.</p>
